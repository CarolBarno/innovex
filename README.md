# springboot-jwt
## An Example Spring Boot Application for Securing a REST API with JSON Web Token (JWT)

This application can be used as a seed to quick start your spring boot REST API project with a fully functional security module.

## Main building blocks
 * Spring Boot 1.5.3.RELEASE go to http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.5.3.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/ to learn more about spring boot
 * JSON Web Token go to https://jwt.io/ to decode your generated token and learn more
 * H2 Database Engine - used for rapid prototyping and development, but not suitable for production at least in most cases. Go to www.h2database.com to learn more


## To run the application
Use one of the several ways of running a Spring Boot application. Below are just three options:

1. Build using maven goal: `mvn clean package` and execute the resulting artifact as follows `java -jar innovex.jar` or
2. On Unix/Linux based systems: run `mvn clean package` then run the resulting jar as any other executable `./innovex.jar`
